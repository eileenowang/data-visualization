# About me
Hi everyone, thanks for visiting my page! I'm Eileen Wang (she/her/hers), a current graduate pursuing my Masters of Integrated Innovation for Products and Services- Advanced Study at Carnegie Mellon University. My focus at CMU is innovating digital products with design thinking processes, quantitative analysis tools, and a product management perspective. Before CMU, I worked in business analytics for 5 years. I focused on developing methods to uncover user pain points, and ways to better synthesize insights. 

After CMU, I'm looking to be a data-driven product manager for a software company. One of the most important skills a good product manager has is the ability to back up initiatives with good data. However, good data is only effective if it's well represented and stakeholders can understand. 

# What I hope to learn
In my class Storytelling with Data, I am looking forward to learning how to communicate with data efficiently and effectively. I think with the skills I learn from this class, I will be able to become more confident in working quantitatively.
